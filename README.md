Exercises from Codecademy React course.

Components lifecycle:
1.- Mounting, when the component is being initialized and put into the DOM for the first time. We saw that the constructor, render(), and componentDidMount() are called during this phase.
2.- Updating, when the component updates as a result of changed state or changed props. We saw that render() and componentDidUpdate() are called during this phase.
3.- Unmounting, when the component is being removed from the DOM. We saw that componentWillUnmount() was called here, which was a good time to clean things up.
